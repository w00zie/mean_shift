# Datasets

These datasets have been synthetically generated with the help of [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_blobs.html). They are extremely simple and lightweight and are not meant to represent any real-world scenario.

They are employed just for the sake of testing the base functionalities of this implementation.

This is, for example, the plot for the `./datasets/2d/500_samples_3_centers` data:

At the moment only synthetic data for 2D and 3D are provided, in the form of CSV files where every row stores a 2D/3D vector of comma-separated real values like
